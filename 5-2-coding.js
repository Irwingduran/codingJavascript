// two gymnastics teams, 'Dolphins' and 'Koalas'.
// there is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// each team competes 3 times, and then the average os the 3 scores is calculated
// (so one average score per team)
// a team only wins if it has at least double the average score od the other team.
// otherwise, no team wins!
